                </header>
                <p>I'm a fan of JavaScript, despite the loose nature of it, which has lead me to desiring more in both the app development side as well as the front end people interface with. I've been working on a project with a group of friends that I hold dear, even though I am not able to contribute as much as I would like these days. The Art you see all over is from this project. I'm hoping to use the knowledge and skills to both further my Career, as well as, further my passion.</p>
